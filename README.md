Code here is included as suplementary material to the PhD thesis titled
"The Microstrip SQUID Amplifier in the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX)"
in Physics at UC Berkeley submitted Sping 2018.

"Thesis code.llb" is a labVIEW library with vi's referenced in the thesis. Using this requires LabVIEW 2013 or later be installed on your computer.

The folder "Windows executables" contains standalone versions of the vi's referenced in the theses. These demonstrate basic functionality, but the source code is not acessible. Windows 7 or later required.
